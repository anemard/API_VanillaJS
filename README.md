Calling and displaying public API in Vanilla JS

Description:
This is was a refresher project to apply a public API call in Vanilla JS. Using the open API from the Art Institute Chicago (https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction), I simply grabbed 5 artworks and displayed these artwork's titles on the DOM. There is also a button that allows the page to add an additional 5 artworks to the DOM one click at a time.
